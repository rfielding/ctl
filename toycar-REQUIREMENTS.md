lets give toycar steering, throttle, brake, forward, reverse, turn signal. make it drive around at random, to exercise all states.

To model this toycar, we can start by creating a state representation for the car and defining its possible states. In this case, the state consists of the following variables: `steering`, `throttle`, `brake`, `forward`, `reverse`, `turn_signal`.

We can represent our car using a dictionary where keys represent the components of the car and the values represent the state of those components. For each component, we will assign a starting value.

Here's a Python dictionary representing our initial state of the car:

```python
initial_state = {
    'steering': 'straight',      # Possible values: "straight", "left", "right"
    'throttle': False,           # Boolean
    'brake': False,              # Boolean
    'forward': False,            # Boolean
    'reverse': False,            # Boolean
    'turn_signal': 'off'         # Possible values: "off", "left", "right"
}
```

Next, let's define how our car changes state. Since you mentioned we want our car to "drive around at random, to exercise all states", we can use a random choice function to select a new state at each time-step.

Here's an oversimplified example of how the state transition function could look using Python:

```python
import random

def transition_function(state):
    # Randomly select new component states
    steering = random.choice(['straight', 'left', 'right'])
    throttle = random.choice([True, False])
    brake = random.choice([True, False])
    forward = random.choice([True, False])
    reverse = not forward if throttle else False  # Can't be in reverse if we're moving forward
    turn_signal = random.choice(['off', 'left', 'right'])
    
    # Return new state
    return {
        'steering': steering,
        'throttle': throttle,
        'brake': brake,
        'forward': forward,
        'reverse': reverse,
        'turn_signal': turn_signal,
    }
```
This function takes the current state as input and returns a new state where each car attribute is randomly chosen from its possible values. 

You could of course make this function more complex and realistic to better represent a real-life toycar model, by including restrictions such as braking while moving must set throttle to False, etc.
