Set project to news

## User @ 2025-05-15T01:02:45.371020

let's parse a news story. we want to demonstrate temporal logic. so we need a markov chain that models the world in such a way that we can make sensible temporal logic statements. write out a model in the python api, render the model as a png referenced from this file, then add in some temporal statements to exercise the functionality. i will take this resulting markdown file and run it with requiprements_parser.py to see if it can handle this md file.  https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/may-14/lewis-and-clark-depart

Okay, let's start by parsing the story and creating a model. It seems like the significant events of this scenario might be:

1. Lewis and Clark depart
2. Enter the plains
3. Meet Shoshone Indians
4. Cross the Continental Divide

We can represent this as a sequence of state changes. In each state, we'll have a variable for the location and a boolean for whether or not Lewis and Clark have met the Shoshone Indians. Here is the specific code to create the model:

```python
# Python code here

states = [
    {"Event": 0, "Location": "Departure", "MetShoshone": False},
    {"Event": 1, "Location": "Plains", "MetShoshone": False},
    {"Event": 2, "Location": "Plains", "MetShoshone": True},
    {"Event": 3, "Location": "Continental Divide", "MetShoshone": True},
]

transitions = {
    hashable({"event": 0, "location": "Departure", "MetShoshone": False}): [
        hashable({"event": 1, "location": "Plains", "MetShoshone": False})
    ],
    hashable({"event": 1, "location": "Plains", "MetShoshone": False}): [
        hashable({"event": 2, "location": "Plains", "MetShoshone": True})
    ],
    hashable({"event": 2, "location": "Plains", "MetShoshone": True}): [
        hashable({"event": 3, "location": "Continental Divide", "MetShoshone": True})
    ],
}

model = Model(states, transitions)
```

Corresponding dot string would be something like:

```python
dot_string = """
digraph G {
    0 [label="0\nLocation=Departure\nMetShoshone=False"];
    1 [label="1\nLocation=Plains\nMetShoshone=False"];
    2 [label="2\nLocation=Plains\nMetShoshone=True"];
    3 [label="3\nLocation=Continental Divide\nMetShoshone=True"];
    
    0 -> 1 [label="1.0"];
    1 -> 2 [label="1.0"];
    2 -> 3 [label="1.0"];
}
"""
functions.graphviz_render({dot_string: dot_string})
```

The Markov chain image: ![Markov Chain](./news-model.png)

Using this model, we can write temporal logic statements using POBTL*. For example:

1. Lewis and Clark will eventually reach the Continental Divide.

```python
location_at_divide = Prop("location_at_divide", lambda s: s["Location"] == "Continental Divide")
assert eval_formula(EF(location_at_divide), model)
```

2. Lewis and Clark met the Shoshone Indians on the Plains.

```python
met_shoshone_on_plains = Prop("met_shoshone_on_plains", lambda s: s["MetShoshone"] == True and s["Location"] == "Plains")
assert eval_formula(EF(met_shoshone_on_plains), model)
```

These statements are interpreted as follows:

1. EF(location_at_divide): There exists a Future path where Lewis and Clark are at the location "Continental Divide".
2. EF(met_shoshone_on_plains): There exists a Future path where Lewis and Clark have met the Shoshone Indians while on the Plains.

excellent!

I'm glad you found that helpful! If you have any other questions or need further assistance in modeling your system or creating temporal logic assertions, feel free to ask.
