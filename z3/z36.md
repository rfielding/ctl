BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT
============================================================
# Business System Requirements: E-commerce Order Processing

*Auto-generated from vibecode business system design*

## System Overview

This document specifies the requirements for the **E-commerce Order Processing** business system.
The system is modeled as communicating Markov chains with formal verification.

## Process Interaction Flow

The following sequence diagram shows how business processes interact:

```mermaid

    Note over payment_service: 5% payment failures
    Note over inventory_service: 2% out of stock
    Note over order_service: 10% validation failures
```

## Business Processes

### order_service

**Description**: Processes payments for orders
**States**: idle, processing_payment, payment_successful, payment_failed
**Initial State**: idle

#### State Diagram

```mermaid

    checking_stock : Checking Stock
    stock_reserved : Stock Reserved
    out_of_stock : Out Of Stock

    [*] --> available
    available --> checking_stock : 10 transitions
    checking_stock --> stock_reserved : 10 transitions
    stock_reserved --> available : 10 transitions
```

### fulfillment_service
**Role**: Order Fulfillment
**Description**: Handles order fulfillment and shipping
**States**: waiting, picking_items, packaging, shipped, delivered
**Initial State**: waiting

#### State Diagram

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    title: Handles order fulfillment and shipping

    waiting : Waiting
    picking_items : Picking Items
    packaging : Packaging
    shipped : Shipped
    delivered : Delivered

    [*] --> waiting
    waiting --> picking_items : 10 transitions
    picking_items --> packaging : 10 transitions
    packaging --> shipped : 10 transitions
```

## Communication Channels

### order_events
**Purpose**: Order lifecycle communication
**Description**: Channel for order-related events
**Capacity**: 100 messages

### payment_requests
**Purpose**: Payment processing coordination
**Description**: Channel for payment processing requests
**Capacity**: 50 messages

### inventory_queries
**Purpose**: Real-time inventory management
**Description**: Channel for inventory availability checks
**Capacity**: 200 messages

## Business Rules

1. Orders must be validated before payment processing
2. Payment must be successful before inventory reservation
3. Inventory must be reserved before fulfillment begins
4. Failed payments must trigger order cancellation within 5 minutes
5. Out-of-stock items must trigger customer notification within 1 minute

## Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

### response_time
**Threshold**: 2.0
**Description**: Order processing response time must be under 2 seconds

### order_completion
**Threshold**: 300.0
**Description**: Order completion must be under 5 minutes

### availability
**Threshold**: 0.999
**Description**: System availability must be 99.9% or higher

### payment_processing
**Threshold**: 10.0
**Description**: Payment processing must complete within 10 seconds

## Formal Verification Properties

The following properties are automatically verified using CTL/PCTL model checking:

### Safety Properties
- **No deadlock**: AG(¬deadlock) - System never reaches a deadlocked state
- **Data integrity**: AG(message_sent → EF message_received) - All messages eventually delivered
- **Mutual exclusion**: AG(¬(process1_critical ∧ process2_critical)) - No resource conflicts

### Liveness Properties
- **Progress**: AG EF progress - System always eventually makes progress
- **Completion**: AF completion - All business processes eventually complete
- **Availability**: AG EF available - System always eventually becomes available

### Performance Properties
- **Response time**: P≥0.95[response_time ≤ threshold] - 95% of responses within SLA
- **Throughput**: P≥0.99[throughput ≥ minimum] - 99% chance of meeting throughput targets
- **Reliability**: P<0.01[G failure] - Less than 1% chance of permanent failure

## Simulation Metrics

The following metrics are tracked during simulation:

### Message Throughput

```mermaid

    title "Message Throughput by Channel"
    x-axis ["Payment Requests", "Order Events", "Inventory Queries"]
    y-axis "Messages" 0 --> 50
    bar [10, 40, 10]
```

### Business Events Distribution

```mermaid
pie title Business Events Distribution
    "Order Received" : 5.0
    "Message Sent Via Order Events" : 20.0
    "Order Validated" : 5.0
    "Message Sent Via Payment Requests" : 5.0

```

### Operational Metrics

- Message throughput per channel
- Queue lengths over time
- Error rates and failure events

### Business Metrics
- Business event frequencies
