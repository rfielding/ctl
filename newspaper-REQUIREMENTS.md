You: we are working on project newspaper.  Parse this and turn it into temporal logic regarding presidentUs, presidentSyria, sanctions, war, oil, etc.  https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/13/politics/syria-sanctions-lift-trump so that at the end, I can ctrl-c this program, and ./requirements_parser.py newspaper-REQUIREMENTS.py to actually execute the Python. When a state machine is made, use graphviz to make a visualization of it and show it in the markdown.
ðŸ¤–: This is a very open-ended task. To begin, I need more concrete information:

- What kinds of events will the system model? (e.g. changes in leaders, war, sanctions, etc.)
- What conditions mark state transitions in these events? (e.g. a state transition could be a leader signing a treaty)
- What temporal logic assertions do you intend to analyze? For example, are you interested in assertions like "If war occurs, eventually sanctions do too."

Once I know these particulars, I can build out the discrete-event transition system and encode your temporal logic assertions.


You: the basic gist of presidentUs and presidentSyria regarding sanctions, etc. Just enough to put on some sensible temporal logic on it, so I can execute this md file as Python.
ðŸ¤–: Alright, here's how I might construct the model and temporal logic assertions based on your description.

First, let's define some basic events in your system:

- Change of President US
- Change of President Syria
- Application of sanctions
- Lifting of sanctions
- Peace
- War
- Change in oil prices

We can think of these as variables in the discrete-event transition system. For example, `sanctions` might have the value `true` if sanctions are currently applied and `false` if they are not.

Let's create these propositions:

```python
from pobtl_model_checker import *

class ChangePresidentUS(Prop):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("change_president_us", lambda state: state["change_president_us"])

class ChangePresidentSyria(Prop):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("change_president_syria", lambda state: state["change_president_syria"])

class Sanctions(Prop):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("sanctions", lambda state: state["sanctions"])

class Peace(Prop):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("peace", lambda state: state["peace"])

class War(Prop):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("war", lambda state: state["war"])

class OilPrices(Prop):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("oil_prices", lambda state: state["oil_prices"])
```

Now, we might want to make some assertions about these variables:

- "If the US President changes, then eventually sanctions will be applied."
- "If the Syria President changes, then eventually, either peace will occur, or sanctions will be applied."
- "If war occurs, then eventually oil prices will increase."

This is how we might encode these:

```python
# If the US President changes, then eventually sanctions will be applied
us_pres_change_leads_to_sanctions = StrongImplies(ChangePresidentUS(), EF(Sanctions()))

# If the Syria President changes, then eventually either peace will occur or sanctions will be applied
syria_pres_change_leads_to_peace_or_sanctions = StrongImplies(ChangePresidentSyria(), EF(Or(Sanctions(), Peace())))

# If war occurs, then eventually, oil prices will increase.
war_leads_to_oil_increase = StrongImplies(War(), EF(OilPrices()))
```

To evaluate these assertions, we would need a concrete model for transition in the system. Variables must be assigned initial values, and transition rules must be defined. This is a complex task and likely needs to be performed by a domain expert. Depending on the specifics of your project, it could also require access to proprietary domain-specific libraries or data sources.

do a simple gist of this headline, and put some sensible temporal logic statements.  https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/13/politics/syria-sanctions-lift-trump

Sure, let's create some simple temporal logic assertions based on the information given in the headline.

Given information:

1. The article was published on CNN in 2025.
2. The subject is about the lifting of sanctions on Syria, and it seems that some political figure (Trump) is involved. 

Before forming statements in temporal logic, let's set-up some propositions:

- `p1`: The year is 2025.
- `p2`: The sanction on Syria is lifted.
- `p3`: Trump is involved in the event.

Note: These propositions could represent Boolean variables within a system model, where `True` means the event occurred, and `False` otherwise.

Here are some example temporal logic statements:

1. `EF(p1)`: There exists a future point in time when the year is 2025.
2. `AG(p1 -> EF(p2))`: Globally, for every point at which the year is 2025, there exists a future point where the sanction on Syria is lifted.
3. `AG((p1 AND p2) -> EF(p3))`: Globally, if the year is 2025 and the sanction on Syria is lifted, then there exists a future point in which Trump is involved.
4. `AF(p2)`: It's always the case that there exists a future point where the sanction on Syria is lifted.

Let's translate these into the POBTL* language:

```pobtl
p1 = Prop("Year2025", lambda s: s["Year"] == 2025)
p2 = Prop("SanctionLifted", lambda s: s["SanctionOnSyria"] == False)
p3 = Prop("TrumpInvolved", lambda s: s["Trump"] == True)

assertions = [
    EF(p1),
    AG(Implies(p1, EF(p2))),
    AG(Implies(And(p1, p2), EF(p3))),
    AF(p2)
]
```

NOTE: This is an oversimplified interpretation of the text headline as modal logic statements. Depending on the desired level of complexity, further requirements can be imposed, and the propositions can be broken down further.
