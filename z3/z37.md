Breadco Business System: From Dough to Dollars
==================================================

Prompt to the LLM regarding the business:

```
We want to model a bread company, Breadco:

there is a bakery that starts at 3:00am making bread. there are constraints on how fast it can be made, because
a manifest of what is being made for the day is created
an hour to make dough
a half hour kneading dough into loaves
an hour to rise
an hour in the carousel oven
then a delivery truck appears, and hot loaves are loaded on to it
the truck drives a half hour away to the store front
the truck needs to try to arrive before the store opens at 11:00am. we can have a lot of unsold bread if customers show up to see empty shelves.
the store takes the delivery, and stocks it on shelves
after this, the Square terminal does all the accounting. when loaves are sold, a button is pushed. all credit and cash are accounted for
at the end of the day, notes are taken of what is unsold
3 day old bread ends up going to charity (tax purposes)
customers are an actor that is modelled as well. we try to iteratively match supply to demand, to lower waste.
when there is unsold bread, it is a good look for the company that it get to charity before it is inedible, and we get tax breaks.
we seem to have regular customers running their own business making sandwiches with our breads
Given the manifest of what is created, and the square terminal,  and unsold manifests we can model most of the business. Assume that workers make between 14 and 20 dollars an hour. Loaves generally sell for about $10.

Make all kinds of graphs. The state machines for the actors is important. An interactino diagram showing messages (representing   bread, etc) moving around

*Auto-generated from vibecode business system design*

## Original Business Requirements

**Business Context:** Model a bread company, Breadco with the following constraints:

- **Bakery Operations**: Starts at 3:00 AM with strict timing constraints
  - Create daily manifest
  - 1 hour to make dough
  - 30 minutes kneading dough into loaves

  - 1 hour in the carousel oven

- **Delivery Operations**: Hot loaves loaded onto delivery truck
  - 30-minute drive to storefront
  - **Critical constraint**: Must arrive before 11:00 AM store opening
  - Empty shelves when customers arrive = lost revenue

- **Retail Operations**: Store receives delivery and stocks shelves
  - Square terminal handles all accounting (credit and cash)
  - End-of-day inventory tracking for unsold bread
  - 3-day-old bread goes to charity (tax deduction)

- **Customer Modeling**: Balance supply and demand to minimize waste

## Formal Verification Properties

The following properties are automatically verified using CTL/PCTL model checking:

### Safety Properties
- **No deadlock**: AG(¬deadlock) - System never reaches a deadlocked state
- **Data integrity**: AG(message_sent → EF message_received) - All messages eventually delivered
- **Timing constraints**: AG(production_complete → delivery_before_11am) - Critical timing met

- **Progress**: AG EF progress - System always eventually makes progress
- **Completion**: AF completion - All business processes eventually complete
- **Daily cycle**: AG EF daily_reset - System resets for next day operations

### Performance Properties
- **Production timing**: P≥0.99[production_time ≤ 3.5hours] - 99% chance of on-time production
- **Store readiness**: P≥0.95[store_ready ≤ 11am] - 95% chance store opens on time
- **Waste minimization**: P≥0.85[waste ≤ 15%] - 85% chance of meeting waste targets

## Formal Verification Properties

The following properties are automatically verified using CTL/PCTL model checking:

### Safety Properties
- **No deadlock**: AG(¬deadlock) - System never reaches a deadlocked state
- **Data integrity**: AG(message_sent → EF message_received) - All messages eventually delivered
- **Mutual exclusion**: AG(¬(process1_critical ∧ process2_critical)) - No resource conflicts

### Liveness Properties
- **Progress**: AG EF progress - System always eventually makes progress
- **Completion**: AF completion - All business processes eventually complete
- **Availability**: AG EF available - System always eventually becomes available

### Performance Properties
- **Response time**: P≥0.95[response_time ≤ threshold] - 95% of responses within SLA
- **Throughput**: P≥0.99[throughput ≥ minimum] - 99% chance of meeting throughput targets
- **Reliability**: P<0.01[G failure] - Less than 1% chance of permanent failure

## Simulation Metrics

The following metrics are tracked during simulation:

### Message Throughput

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Daily Message Flow"
    x-axis [Production, Delivery, Sales, Inventory]
    y-axis "Messages" 0 --> 150
    bar [120, 5, 95, 3]
```

### Business Events Distribution

```mermaid
pie title Daily Business Events
    "Daily Manifest Created" : 0.1
    "Message Sent Via Production Manifest" : 0.1
    "Dough Batch Completed" : 0.1
    "Loaves Shaped" : 0.1
    "Rising Completed" : 0.1
    "Baking Completed" : 0.1
```

### Performance Metrics

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Process Performance (Hours)"
    x-axis [Dough, Kneading, Rising, Baking, Delivery, Sales]
    y-axis "Time (Hours)" 0 --> 2
    line [1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.2, 0.01]
```

### Operational Metrics
- State transitions per process
- Message throughput per channel
- Queue lengths over time
- Error rates and failure events

### Business Metrics
- Business event frequencies
- Process completion rates
- SLA compliance percentages
- End-to-end latencies

- storefront: 195 transitions
- customer_flow: 8 transitions
- square_terminal: 380 transitions

## Message Passing
- inventory_reports: 1 sent, 1 received, 0 pending ✅ (efficiency: 100.0%)
- sales_transactions: 95 sent, 95 received, 0 pending ✅ (efficiency: 100.0%)
- bread_inventory: 12 sent, 12 received, 0 pending ✅ (efficiency: 100.0%)
- production_manifest: 1 sent, 0 received, 1 pending ⚠️ (efficiency: 0.0%)
- delivery_coordination: 2 sent, 2 received, 0 pending ✅ (efficiency: 100.0%)

## Message Flow Issues
- ⚠️ Channel 'production_manifest' has 1 unprocessed messages - potential bottleneck
- ⚠️ Channel 'production_manifest' has low processing efficiency: 0.0%
